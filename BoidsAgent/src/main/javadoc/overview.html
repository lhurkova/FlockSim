      BoidsAgent is a plug-in for FlockSim application. It implements the behavior of birds during formating and mantaing a flock. BoidsAgent is based on BOIDS model that introduces three main flocking rules: cohesion, separation and alignment. Cohesion rule means that a birds is trying to get to the center of the flock. Separation rule means that a bird is trying to get away form birds that are too close to it. Alignment rule means that a bird is trying to align its direction with other birds.
