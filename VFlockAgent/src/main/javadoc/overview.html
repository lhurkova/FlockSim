      <p>
      VFlockAgent is a plug-in for FlockSim application. It implements the behavior of birds during formating and mantaing a V-shaped flock. VFlockAgent follows two main rules during the flock formation: cohesion and clear view rule. Cohesion rule means that a birds is trying to get closer to the closest bird in the flock that the birds see. Clear view rule mean that a bird is trying to keep an empty space in front of it so that it has a clear view.
